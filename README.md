# Echo State Networks

```reproduce_MG.ipynb``` and ```esn.py```: reproduce the results in [pyESN](https://github.com/cknd/pyESN). Notice that my implementation is slightly different because I use the ESNs described in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 024102](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.024102). And ```mackey_glass_t17.npy``` is from [pyESN](https://github.com/cknd/pyESN). 

You can run ```reproduce_MG.ipynb``` in Jupyter Notebook or ```python esn.py``` in terminal.
